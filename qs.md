    I have a strong affiliation with your brand. I do my shopping on Amazon, I self published some books for children on your platform (my leisure time hobby), I watch the latest movies on Prime. You are a part of my everyday routine, and I love the way how everything is centered around the customer here, how easy the shopping experience is, and that you always try to come up with some innovations for people. What’s more, I’ve had a job of a financial analyst for six years. Reading the job description I really feel that I would fit to your team at Amazon, and that the position of a senior analyst matches perfectly my skills and experience.
    When I saw a job opening in your Amazon Kids & Family team, I immediately knew I found the right match for my experience and professional interests. I would love to help you develop meaningful digital experiences for families, and I have experience with working on consumer facing digital products across a variety of mediums. This job fits perfectly into my career plan, and is a next logical step after everything I have done up to this point.
    What’s more, I have heard just the best things about the working environment in Amazon from both your former and present employees—some of them belong to my professional circles. I know you expect a lot from the workers, but that’s exactly what I am looking for in work. I’d love to move forward, to push my limits, to get better in what I do. That would definitely be possible in the amazing team of people you have in place here.
    I think that you have the best customer service in the world—speaking form the experience of a buyer, and I would love to join such a team of workers. What’s more, the ability to work from home really suits my current situation, and everything that happened in our country as a result of covid pandemic. I am driven, motivated to learn and work hard, and I would feel proud working for Amazon AWS.

 

    To be honest, I just love the idea of working for Amazon. I know that I apply “only” for a job in a warehouse, but still–if you should work with parcels and operate a modern forklift, there is, in my view, no better place to do it than Amazon. First of all, you have the most modern equipment in place. Secondly, you have an excellent system of work–at least that’s what I’ve read, and one can certainly learn a lot working in this warehouse. Last but not least, you pay the warehouse clerks better than vast majority of other employers. To sum it up, I would be extremely happy to work here, because considering my qualifications and education, this is as good a job as I can get at the moment.
    I am a firm believer in a whole-food based diet. A typical American eats a complete garbage, and it is a reason no. 1 why we have such a big problem with obesity, and the diseases of civilization. I’ve been working as a purchasing agent for years, but now I would like to work for a company where I can really make a big difference with my work, helping to get an amazing quality produce from all around the country to the table of Americans who seek such produce. Needless to say, an impact you can have working as a buyer for Amazon is ten times bigger than an impact you can have working for any other company in the field, and hundred times bigger than the one you can have working for a small local player. I want to have an impact, and believe to have the skills and experience to be ready to work for Amazon. That’s why.
    I want to work for Amazon AWS because the 14 leadership principles resonate with me strongly. You know, each company has some identity, vision, goals. But I have never found a better match to what I believe into when it comes to my interaction with both customers and colleagues, than your 14 leadership principles. I hate to be average. On the contrary, I love to innovate and simplify things, and I aim only for the highest standards, in everything I do. I think that my resume and the things I achieved in my previous jobs prove my words…
    I want to learn from the best. It is as simple as that. I have a great academic record, and I’ve tried to get as much working experience as possible while still studying. Now, when I finally earned my degree and completed my internship, I want to have the best possible start to my “real” professional career. Luckily for me you are hiring big right now, for many entry level positions, and I believe to have the motivation and attitude to make it through, become the member of your team, learn from the best, and hopefully stay for years with Amazon.
